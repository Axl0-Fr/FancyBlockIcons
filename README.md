# Fancy Block Icons
    This is a repository for custom icons based on the icons you see when you have Minecraft open!

# How to Contibute
    If you want to contibute create a fork and create a name-space with your name in 'Icons', You can also create one in 'Resources' if you plan on sharing your textures with the main fork.

## Nameing images
    Naming your images corectly is VERY important, it just keeps everything cleaner.

### Icons
    When naming a icon is a simple as `[BlockName] Icon` i.g: 'GrassBlock Icon', if you update your icon you should add `v[Version Number]` i.g: 'GrassBlock Icon v.2'.

### Resources/Textures
    If your texture isn't split up just name it its `[BlockName]` i.g: 'GrassBlock'

    But if it is split up name it `[BlockName] [Face: Front, Side, Top, Back]`
